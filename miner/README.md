Put your KFC Crypto coin miner code in this folder (not necessarily in this
readme).  Feel free to brag about it in this `README.md`.

Note: a starter script is included in this directory, this script is probably bad
since it was written by me in < 5 minutes so probably has things like relative paths
and no comments...

Made a really simple, yet likely more complicated than necessary, script to loop through a word in the dictionary and increment a nonce
with each word that increases from(arbitrarily decided) numbers. Pulled a simple dictionary from https://classroominthemiddle.com/spring-word-list/
No reason specifically behind choosing this one other than it appeared in a simple word list search and was formatted simply enough to not
require much modification when added to the dictionary. Quite pleased overall with how it turned out, wish couldve found even higher rarity
coins but did find 2 rarity 5 coins before stopping searching due to its time consumption.
